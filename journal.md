# AI Vision System

## The Premise

I'll be designing a compact product, that'll be able to describe a scene presented to the camera, giving a description to aid a person who is visually impaired.

## Criteria for Success
- Safe to Use
	- Doesn't get hot in the users hands
	- Isn't sharp
	- Is able to be easily carried around
	- Is durable, and able to take some damage without posing a safety risk due to sharp edges or burs that may appear.
- Convenient 
	- The user actually wants to use it
		- Fast load times (under 5 seconds from button press to an accurate and detailed description)
	- Long lasting power solution
- Accesible
	- Easy to press button
	- Physical feedback to the user
	- Doesn't require cellular connectivity.

## Day 1 - Definition

So.. to start off, the main controller. My reaserch indicates that I essentially have 3 main options:
- Raspberry Pi CM5
- Orange Pi CM5
- Radxa CM5

I'm ultimately very fond of the compute module as a form factor, while packing in an insane amount of power.

After comparing the 3, the RPi version was quickly eliminated. It simply wouldn't be able to provide the required processing time, making the user experience slow and buggy. 

When choosing between the Radxa and Orange Pi, I ultimately did some research on the community available support, as well as availability. This yielded the Radxa to be the most suitable solution. Based on how things go with the budget, at the end, I'll either choose between the 8GB or 16GB RAM versions. This gives a bit of wiggle room in terms of design.

Currently, my main focus will be on the PCB and Case, working on the software once that is done.

The case will be made from 2 pieces of billet aluminium, serving as a heatsink, to allow for optimal operation. More on this to come.
